# iOS Interview Test Project

Please create a small iOS application that displays our usecases.

###Task###
- Create an iOS app project on Bitbucket / Github etc.
- A UITabBar where the user can select from three tabs. The icons for each tab are optional.
- The first tab should look like a Login Screen with 
  * a headline, a label, two textfields and a button 
  * One textfield is for normal text, the other is for a password 
  * The button should have a customized design (cyan background, white font color) 
  * When clicking the button, an Alert should show up: “Hello Motius”.
- The second tab should include a tableview that users can scroll through. It should display our usecases:
  * Please select one or multiple dummy images to display for each cell 
  * Please get the elements for this tableview from our API
  * Build a connection, get the JSON object, and parse it in order to display the title and the body element for each object
  * Please build a system where the main thread is not blocked by this action 
  * Feel free to design that screen more beautiful than in our example ;)
- screen maybe empty. Feel free to hide an easter egg there :)

The API offered by the platform can be looked up in the code.

###Non-functional Requirements###
- Min. iOS version should be iOS 9
- Use either Swift or Objective-C
- You don’t have to try to re-build the screens pixel-perfect
- Good code structure and correct iOS guidelines are important
